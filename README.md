Grapevine is a Laravel 5.0+ compatible package built to provide discussion forum functionality to your application.

## Setting Up

`git clone git@github.com:floatingpointsoftware/grapevine`
`composer update`

That's it! Seriously!

If you want to run the unit tests to make sure everything is working:

`./vendor/bin/phpunit`

If you would like to generate the API documentation:

`./vendor/bin/apigen --config apigen.neon`

This will drop them in the docs/ directory (which is gitignored)
